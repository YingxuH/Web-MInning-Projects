       " \"provides good grip and cushion.<br />&#62;Body: Channels prevent rotation.<br />&#62;Thumb locks: Operate quickly and smoothly, and lock securely---actually mine works just a tad too easily. I fear that with a little wear, that the locks will slip.  Unlike the less-convenient &#34;twist to lock&#34; design (used on many other monopods/tripods), you can't just &#34;twist harder&#34;---there is nothing you can do if the lock doesn't hold.  Honestly, I am torn about applying a little silicon grease to the locks to minimize wear, and the concern that the grease might encourage slipping.  If you get one with tight leg locks, the silicon grease is highly recommended, it will both make the action smoother and protect against wear---lightly apply to the levers where they rub against the monopod column.  [[ASIN:B000AL8VD2 Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.]] Note that unlike petroleum grease, silicon grease does not damage plastic or attract dirt.<br />&#62;Tip:  Metal tip for hard surfaces; plastic tip screws out over metal tip for indoor surfaces.  Neither tip can come loose and get lost.  The metal tip is not particularly sharp, and the plastic tip is not soft.  That is, the metal tip might slip on smooth rocks or hard ice, and while the plastic tip will protect most indoor surfaces from scratches, it does little to protect your camera from the jarring of impacts (which is VERY bad for cameras).  Therefore it is best NOT to leave your camera on your monopod if you use the monopod as a walking stick.  A &#34;quick connect&#34; such as [[ASIN:B00006JQ6C Sima Quick Connect for Tripod]] can be handy.<br />&#62;Case:  Rugged, attractive black nylon, with full-length zipper and an adjustable shoulder strap.  Unfortunately the case will not close with a ball head attached.  The usual plastic fittings will not rust, but can be broken by abusive use.<br /><br />AS A TRAVEL MONOPOD<br />At 21&#34; collapsed the monopod is too large to fit in most airplane carry-on luggage.  Airport security will probably confiscate it if found.  17oz is on the heavy side for travel.  For travel, I use a very similar [[ASIN:B000W8SSDG Norazza Monopod-lightweight TD140]], which collapses to 15 ½&#34; x ¾&#34; diameter, weighs only 7oz, but is too short (52&#34;) for birding and some other situations.<br /><br />AS A TRAVEL MONOPOD / WALKING STICK / HIKING POLE<br />A proper hiking pole needs a substantial strap, so that you do not have to have a death-grip on the grip for hours at a time.  The supplied lanyard is totally inadequate for this purpose and cannot be replaced with a more substantial strap.  However, if use a ballhead, you can install the ends of a replacement strap beneath the ball head.  I have not found replacement straps for sale---but you can make one from a 12&#34; length of 1&#34; black nylon webbing you probably have lying around from old equipment---use a soldering gun to cauterize 1/4&#34; holes in the webbing, 1/2&#34; from each end.  For travel, when I will be hiking, I use a [[ASIN:B000MB6T2U Stansport Outdoorsman Trekking Pole]] which has camera threads (and therefore can be used as a monopod), and has a very sharp metal tip for gripping ice or rocks and a very shock absorbing rubber tip for indoor surfaces (but I use the rubber tip outdoors to protect my camera from jarring).<br /><br />ESSENTIAL ACCESSORY<br />MANY reviewers report that the head (where your camera screws onto the monopod) can break off attached to your camera, and then can be difficult to remove from your camera.  The best insurance against damage to your camera is to use a ball-head or tilt head, which I consider essential anyway (or a &#34;quick connect&#34; see above).  For example, [[ASIN:B000L47AHG Professional Mini Ball Head Camera Mount]] which is adequate for small to medium-size cameras.  Unfortunately the monopod will not fit in the case with the ball-head attached.

       " \"got something that helped me with much more.<br /><br />The following review is a chronological account of a month long trial of this supplement with some extended updates. I hope it will help you to decide whether this product is for you.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE: Any mention of my health issues added to this review was done in hopes of assisting others who may be interested in taking this supplement. I generally don't like to share personal information such as medical conditions in a review, but I feel that for those suffering from similar conditions, it may be helpful. However, this is just my experience with this product and I in no way advocate using it to treat any of your ills without first consulting your doctor.<br /><br />What led me to this supplement, a little background...<br /><br />I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 15 years ago by Dr. David Dryland; a rheumatologist who is also a nationally known specialist in fibromyalgia. (He and has a few books on Amazon: [[ASIN:0976649004 The Fibromyalgia Cure]] and [[ASIN:0446698172 The Fibromyalgia Solution: A Breakthrough Approach to Heal Your Body and Take Back Your Life]].)  While I've taken various medications in the past to manage FMS, they all seem to have side effects - including the ones prescribed by Dr. Dryland.<br /><br />Currently I manage my fibro with no prescribed medication. I believe in a holistic approach to health, using both western and naturopathic means in combination as needed for various things.<br /><br />I take ibuprofen, eat healthy foods, get rest as needed and exercise. I lift weights and do 20-30 minutes of moderate to intense cardio 3-4 times a week, and take several supplements including: Optimum Nutrition Opti-Women, Women's Multivitamin, 120 Capsules, CoQ10, Fish Oil, Biotin, Red Rice Yeast, and Jarrow Formulations Jarrow L-glutamine 1000mg, 100 Tablets.<br /><br />Recent fatigue combined with hair loss has led to extensive blood tests by an endocrinologist to look at my hormone levels and thyroid function; both of which showed no abnormalities. Imaging tests showed the thyroid to be `lumpy' but  normal. A CT scan showed a cyst on my adrenal gland, which was determined to be benign.<br /><br />Symptomatically I have also experienced brain fog (unclear thoughts, `word salad' - picking the wrong word to express myself verbally, memory loss), irritability, insomnia, hair loss and hot flashes.<br /><br />Reading an article on adrenal fatigue, I decided to look for a book on it on Amazon, I found this supplement.<br /><br />I asked my primary doctor about `adrenal fatigue' and he wasn't convinced it was a real thing. Despite this, he said that trying Gaia Herbs Adrenal Health shouldn't be harmful, so I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />NOTE: Please ask your doctor prior to trying this supplement or any supplement as they can be harmful to some.<br /><br />More info on this supplement can be found at GaiaHerbs dot com in their products section.<br /><br />MY 1st WEEK:<br /><br />I took the recommended dosage - 2 capsules, twice a day after meals. I noted no stomach upset with Adrenal Health, but did note a persistent headache and stuffy head all week. I had also gotten a flu shot so perhaps it was all my immune system finding a balance again?<br /><br />On a positive note, I have felt more positive, and calmer overall. I still get stressed, but the feeling seems to subside a bit more quickly than usual.<br /><br />I'm still achy and tired, but that too seems a touch less pronounced. (One thing about fibro is that your body is in a constant state of 'fight or flight', which means a high level of adrenaline is being released all the time. This makes your muscles and tendons ache, and no amount of relaxing thoughts, will calm it down if you're in a flare - which can last for months.)<br /><br />I have been able to concentrate and complete tasks more easily too. My focus is better, with short term memory returning. (I've been enjoying Scrabble on my iPad again, after months of being unable to do so without frustration.)<br /><br />I've slept pretty well, having a few dreams, which is rare for me. No groggy feeling in the morning, and other than the headache (which could be from allergies, a cold coming on, my flu shot, or these pills...), I feel pretty good.<br /><br />As a bonus my appetite for sugary sweets and carbs has dropped off significantly. My appetite in general is less, and the usual evening (9pm-11pm) snacking is gone. I'm starting to drop body fat that's been stubbornly hanging onto my midsection for months, and have dropped two pounds in a week without changing anything other than taking this supplement.<br /><br />I'm not ready to scream 'buy these' at the top of my lungs to anyone with FMS, CFS or similar ills, but right now, I'm feeling like these subtle, positive changes are a direct result of the only new thing in my routine: Gaia Herbs Adrenal Health.<br /><br />I will update this review\",\n",
       " 'got a lot of cat hair up with it and the cleaning ladies had already been here with their Dyson. So kudos for Panasonic I guess. And the cleaning lady tried it out and liked it quite a bit. High praise, believe me.<br /><br />I do have two beefs, however.<br /><br />One is not with the vacuum cleaner but with the listing here on the site (unless Amazon has fixed it). You know that place down below the write up that says \\\\\\\\\"Frequently Bought Together\\\\\\\\\"? Well there is a HEPA filter listed that does not go with this vacuum cleaner. Does not fit. Useless. Two other people have reviewed the filter itself and have gotten stuck with this filter that doesn\\'t fit a similar Panasonic canister vacuum either. One of the reviews for the filter is 6 month\\'s old, too. The filter is too small. And I own it, and it\\'s not worth sending back for $6 I guess. Amazon, you need to fix this.<br /><br />The second beef is that apparently there are no filters to be had for this that are OEM equipment. This is a big no-no directed at Panasonic. Come on, boys, catch up and provide some filters for this thing. I\\'m not sure I would have bought this if I had known that the HEPA filter that fit it is apparently not available on Amazon or anywhere else ... except maybe as a last resort you can call an 800 number at Panasonic. Not exactly modern marketing. I am ordering a filter meant for Kenmore and another Panasonic model that should fit based on the dimensions, and should be good quality. I will report back.<br /><br />[NOTE: Since writing this (last night) I found a review',\n",
       " 'got disrupted by anti-Red protests.<br /><br />The Weavers disbanded in 1952 but in Dec. \\'55 they reunited for a sold out Carnegie Hall show that was recorded by indie label VANGUARD, an [[ASIN:B000RQ6UDS LP]] that sold well. It took until a 1968 appearance on THE SMOTHERS BROTHERS COMEDY HOUR for Seeger to finally get beyond the broadcast ban. In that light and given the volatile times, it\\'s surprising COLUMBIA was willing to issue his DANGEROUS SONGS!? (CL 2503/CS9303) album in \\'66, as some of its tracks were anti-Vietnam War.<br /><br />The LP\\'s premise is that songs of protest have existed for many centuries, and in some unusual forms.<br /><br />The nursery rhyme \\\\\\\\\"Robin the Bobbin\\\\\\\\\" dates to Henry the Eighth\\'s takeover of the Church of England. \\\\\\\\\"Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary\\\\\\\\\" is believed to be an expression of the Scots\\' disapproval of their Queen, her lavish court and French chef. Although very abstract, \\\\\\\\\"Little Jack Horner\\\\\\\\\" represents a man who in Henry\\'s time testified against the elderly abbot of Glastonbury. As a reward, John Horner was given a portion of seized Church lands (his Xmas pie).<br /><br />Published in the early 19th Century but dating to earlier times, \\\\\\\\\"Thoughts Are Free,\\\\\\\\\" the German protest against censorship and political oppression was used by anti-Nazi Resistance members in WWII. (Pete says Hitler banned the song.) \\\\\\\\\"Jackaro\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Old Man\\\\\\\\\" are from a time when marriages were arranged and lovers had no rights of choice. Seeger performs the latter with an Irish accent, although he\\'s not certain of its origin. Using the Methodist hymn \\\\\\\\\"Say Brother, Will You Meet Us on Canaan\\'s Happy Shore,\\\\\\\\\" some of the Civil War\\'s first African American troops (regiments from Maine) wrote the lyrics to \\\\\\\\\"John Brown\\'s Body.\\\\\\\\\"<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"Going Across\\\\\\\\\" is played on a fretless mountain banjo. This ballad from the Great Smokies was given to carpenter/tobacco farmer Frank Proffitt by his grandfather. It\\'s the song of a mountain man who joins the Union Army. (Proffitt\\'s grandpa also taught him Tom Dooley; Frank passed it on to folkies like the Kingston Trio.) Martyred coal miners organizer \\\\\\\\\"Harry Simms\\\\\\\\\" was honored by this song in 1932. Lyrics to \\\\\\\\\"King Henry\\\\\\\\\" are adapted from a Vietnam War soldier\\'s letter home. He was killed just weeks later. \\\\\\\\\"Ode to Joy\\\\\\\\\" is a solo banjo melody borrowed from Beethoven\\'s 9th Symphony. \\\\\\\\\"Goliath, Goliath\\\\\\\\\" is a nursery rhyme written in Feb. of \\'66. \\\\\\\\\"Queen Anne Front\\\\\\\\\" is about what became of great-grandpa\\'s house after he was laid to rest.<br /><br />Joe Hill\\'s adaptation of \\\\\\\\\"Casey Jones\\\\\\\\\" is a circa WWI commentary on working conditions at San Diego\\'s docks. \\\\\\\\\"One Grain of Sand\\\\\\\\\" is an a capella performance of a song about overpopulation. It has numerous lyrics, not heard here. On a related subject, \\\\\\\\\"The Pill\\\\\\\\\" was composed by Glasgow\\'s Matt McGill, a man with a houseful of kids (22!) who doesn\\'t want any more. Fellow Weaver Fred Hellerman plays guitar and harmonizes on Phil Ochs\\' witty anti-war ballad, \\\\\\\\\"Draft Dodger Rag.\\\\\\\\\" Seeger plays \\\\\\\\\"Mao Tse Tung\\\\\\\\\" on an ocarina. His original \\\\\\\\\"Death Row\\\\\\\\\" was written New Year\\'s Day, \\'66. The prison reference is allegorical. Pete wrote the tune for \\\\\\\\\"Full Fontal\\\\\\\\\" and composed the neo-Shakespearean \\\\\\\\\"Perchance\\\\\\\\\" poem.

If I roll it up tightly and strap it together with the carrying strap, the total width is about 7.5 inches. That’s not too bad, but it has more bulk than the thin mats.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have is that it had a rather funky smell when I first took it out of the plastic wrapper.

There are multiple modes/options on the books when touched by the Leap Pen and kids seem to be unable to focus on the task they first opted for. The publishers seem to justify the higher cost of the system books by providing more content options - learning, playing, having content read back, etc. but these options have an adverse effect - or distracting the child. I could not get my 4 year old niece to focus on one activity for more than 2 pages. The package also includes a one-time use sheet pad that requires special handling.

       " 'got the bed so, when I saw this pillow advertised as a memory foam pillow, I ordered it.<br /><br />My first error was that I apparently did not read the product description fully, because this is not at ALL what I expected.  Most memory foam pillows are quite slim, but this one is HUGE and doesn\\'t feel at all like a memory foam pillow.  I guess the difference is that this pillow has memory foam at its core but is, in fact, a regular pillow AROUND a foam core, so you don\\'t feel the foam at all (after much use, when the regular pillow stuffing gets flatter, you would probably feel it, but definitely not when it is new).<br /><br />The pillow is very nice looking and seems very well made, so even though it wasn\\'t what I had expected, I looked forward to trying it.  Well...the first night didn\\'t go so well.  I don\\'t think I made it 5 minutes before I had to throw it off the bed and revert to my old pillow.  I am a side sleeper with a very short neck and this pillow is 5-6\\\\\\\\\" high.  I just could not get comfortable enough to go to sleep using this pillow.  The next night, I fared better and got to sleep but think I ended up switching back to my old pillow during the night.  I kept trying it, and it kept ending up on the floor, so I moved it back to my combination guest room/office.  I take naps there some days, so I have continued to use it off and on; it seems to work better for a short nap than for a full night\\'s sleep--for me at least.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  If you like a high, firm pillow or have a long neck, this may work great for you.  If you prefer a slimmer pillow and/or are a side sleeper like me, this may not be the best pillow for you.  I suspect that, once I am able to use the pillow enough that the batting around the memory core compresses, it could be a very comfortable pillow.  As of now, though, it is still relegated to the guest bed.<br /><br />Note:  Some reviews commented that this pillow would not fit their regular pillowcases.  I happened to have a set of new pillowcases still in the package that I was going to use for a craft project and they fit this pillow (just barely), so I didn\\'t personally have a problem with that.

       " \"provided to me at no cost for evaluation.<br /><br />There are so many bluetooth speakers out there that it can make your head spin. It takes something special to even get my attention anymore. When I was offered the opportunity to test this speaker I accepted the offer becasue I was interested in seeing the unique design this speaker has. It is very elegant, graceful and smoothly sculpted. It connects via Bluetooth and provides NFC pairing as well.<br /><br />The speaker is about the size of a baseball. On the bottom is an on/off sliding switch. The back has a Micro USB chgarging port and LED indicator for charging status. When the battery is getting low, the indicator begins to flash slowly to let you know, When being charged the LED is solid and goes of when fully charged.<br /><br />Voice prompts seem to be popular with many bluetooth speakers recently. I find voice prompts to be obnoxious and most speakers don't give you the option to turn them off. This speaker does. It's very easy to turn them off simply by going into bluetooth pairing mode then pressing either the previous or next button. Voice prompts are replaced by tones in this mode. To switch back to voice prompts, do the same procedure.<br /><br />The top of the speaker has a round touch panel. In the middle is the multi-function, bluetooth/play/pause/handsfree button. To the left and right are the previous and next buttons. At the top and bottom are the volume up and down buttons. A tiny microphone is located on the top as well.<br /><br />As a handsfree\",\n",

However over my phone's bluetooth signal they were bright and almost had too much high frequency response with almost no bottom (bass). I would crank the phone volume level along with the headphones' level to their utmost limit (at the expense of my hearing) and the headphones would not distort. It got me to thinking.<br /><br />So i fired up my bluetooth laptop that had a hi-fidelity (A2DP) bluetooth transmit option and low and behold I got the headphones I paid my $50 for! As a benchmark comparison test, I put them head to head with my Sennheiser PX 100-II and they are about 75% similar in audio performance. For obvious reasons, you can't beat wired headphones with all things equal but I enjoy listening to both of these headphones. Compared to my PX 100-II headphones, these set of headphones are a little brighter and the upper midrange is a little hyped and colored, but the bass is solid and very musical and definite. In their defense, you can say the PX 100-II is more round and bass heavy but musical.

After plugging the device in I waited quite a while and finally the computer just said it could not find a driver. So I went ahead and put the CD in anyway. After a while the autorun or whatever also failed. So I looked in \\\\\\\\\"Computer\\\\\\\\\" and saw the CD there, clicked on it and went from there OK.<br /><br />The software is simple but not as crude as I had expected from other reviews. It looks like the only edit feature you have is an ability to change the size between 90% to 120% of original. I\\'m hoping my non-technical wife can learn to do this stuff by herself, so for us simplicity is a virtue. I really like the software in some ways... it acts as a viewer to let you see good-sized icons of the embroidery designs in any folder you select on your hard drive or connected USB. Then you can select one design and see a more detailed preview, or get a thread color chart for it. Also the actual dimensions are shown at the bottom of the screen, and they change to reflect any size percentage you might change to. And you can select either inch or metric units for the program.<br /><br />An embroidery file by itself just looks like any old file if you look at it without this viewer feature. It can be pretty hard to find the one you want when they just have numbers for names; there is no immediate way to see what the design looks like or what its dimensions will be. We\\'ve had some viewers before, but they were separate from any other software we use so I never really learned to use them. So although our newer embroidery machine allows you to transfer the designs by standard USB stick it can still be a pain to do. With the good previews and decent navigation, this setup is actually better, in that way.<br /><br />The card they give you has plenty adequate capacity, but must be pretty small compared to the average SD card nowadays. Two average embroidery designs use up about 20% of the card capacity, according to the indicator bar on the software screen. This is just meant for transferring designs a few at a time, not for storing hundreds of them. Take care of the durned card, as they cost almost as much as the complete setup together.to transfer the designs by standard USB stick it can still be a pain to do. With the good preview']"

       "[\"Got this for our 21 month old for Christmas.  It is a very durable, good rolling truck.  It is easy to release the cars from the back.  As stated in other reviews you can use pretty much any car (hot wheels, etc.)  You can have the sound on or off.  I didn't rate this car highier because it was played with a lot on Christmas morning by all 4 of the boys but it is rarely played with now.  Please note that I have FOUR BOYS which means the house is crawling with cars and trucks and lots of car ramps as well.  If you are just starting your toy collection I think it would be a big hit.\",\n",
       " \"I got it and does okay. In retrospect I should have gone to my local Electronics store and bought a better one with rings for the same price. I had seen a review (prior to buying this) that stated that once full it was cumbersome to flip through. That person is completely right it is a pain to flip through and they also stated the same thing mentioned above that it would benefit from binder rings to stabilize it. When I got mine and filled it I realized what they meant. Also the Zipper seems to be unstable and poorly placed.<br /><br />I can't completely knock it since I tossed all the jewel cases that I had as well as a CD spindle that was twice the size and not able to hold half of my collection. I saved my music CD booklets and slid them in the CD sleeves so that was cool  since it fits. Basically at the moment I have about 20 sleeves left. Forgot to mention I do not only have Music CD's in this binder I also have my DVD and Blu-Ray Discs in there as well as PC Software Discs.\",\n",
       " 'I spent weeks trying to decide on a tablet for myself and decided that I wouldn\\'t spend more than $300 (sorry Apple, too rich for my blood).  I was suprised at how many decent option were out there in my price range, but all those that I played with just seemed like the hardware couldn\\'t keep up with the OS.  I stumbled across this tablet on Amazon and was amazed at how well it was being reviewed by people who would know a decent tablet.  I finally decided to pull the trigger after watching a professional review video.  It seemed so snappy and transitions were smooth.  I\\'ve had the tablet now for 3 days and I\\'m very satisfied with my purchase and amazed I got it for less than $200.  Other than a couple of random freezes that required a reset (which was quick and painless) it has lived up to everything I had hoped.    This does not feel like a sub $200 tablet.  I went and played with a lot of low-end Android tablets in department stores around town and they all felt like cheap, plastic toys.  This thing is incredibly solid with no creaking, twisting, etc.  The chrome end pieces give it a very high quality feel and the back panel texture is very nice to hold.  I\\'ve been able to find every app that I was looking for in the market and had no problems installing any of them.  The new \\\\\\\\\"World of Goo\\\\\\\\\" on the Market runs silky smooth and is a better playing experience than on my Wii.  I was worried about finding a case for this since there isn\\'t much on the manufacturers website, but after reading a few other reviews, I tried a Targus Zierra leather portfolio for the original iPad and while it\\'s not a perfect fit, it\\'s pretty close and all ports, buttons, etc are left exposed and accessible.    I am seriously considering buying another one of these so that my kids will stop asking to play with mine, but the problem is that the cat is out of the bag and every place I\\'ve looked is now showing out of stock.  My advice, if you\\'re like me and don\\'t have the money or the coolnessto get an iPad, find a way to track one of these down.',\n",
       " \"EVALUATION<br />This is a full-size monopod---not a gorilla of a monopod, but full-size. Ironically the very same monopod is sold under different brandnames as a &#34;light weight&#34;, as a &#34;heavy duty&#34;, and as a &#34;professional&#34; monopod---it is NONE of these.  Given that it is actually an average weight (at best), light-duty, amateur monopod, it is an excellent design, and a very good value.<br /><br />The monopod is NOT &#34;professional grade&#34;, meaning that it probably will NOT stand up to abuse, and/or constant use, and/or a heavy cameras with a 1000mm lens.  Nevertheless a careful pro who occasional uses a monopod for a small to medium-size camera (or is careful to balance larger loads) would probably be very pleased with it.  It does everything a monopod should do, and does those things well.  It operates quickly and easily, and is very sturdy, proving solid support.  Read the 1-star reviews carefully, but take them &#34;with a grain of salt.&#34;<br /><br />IDENTICAL MONOPODS WITH OTHER BRANDNAMES (may be cheaper)<br />Except for a very slightly different grip, the AmazonBasics is absolutely identical with the [[ASIN:B003WPTBAK Vivitar VIV-VT-67 67-Inch Monopod]] or Opteka [[ASIN:B0002RBQO0 Opteka MP100 67&#34; Professional Heavy Duty Photo / Video Monopod]]. Except for a green case, the  the Dolica [[ASIN:B000VZS2EU Dolica WT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod]] is identical to the other brandnames.  Exactly the same monopod is sold under the &#34;Digital Pro&#34; brandname.<br /><br />VITAL STATISTICS<br />&#62;Length: 21 ¼&#34; long fully-collapsed; 67&#34; tall fully extended<br />&#62;Diameter: uppermost section is 1&#34;;  foam grip 1 3/8&#34;; strap ferrule 1 ½&#34;<br />&#62;Weight: 14 oz; case 3 oz; total 17 oz<br /><br />FEATURES<br />&#62;Maximum Height: 67&#34;.  More than tall enough for most purposes.<br />&#62;Minimum Height:  21&#34;, 23--24&#34; with a (virtually required) ballhead/tilt-head.  Is a little tall for some closeup nature subjects.<br />&#62;Head (camera threads, etc.): The design is odd, with an free-wheeling plastic collar around a small metal stem (and camera threads), the collar is free-wheeling so that it will not scratch the base of your camera--but you still have to rotate the monopod or your camera to screw them together, or apart. (A few confused reviewers thought that they could just turn the collar to attach/detach the camera, and when that didn't work, they thought it was broken.  Turning the collar doesn't do anything, that's just the way it is).<br />&#62;Lanyard: adequate for hanging the monopod from a hook, but too weak to rely on for as a walking stick hand strap.<br />&#62;Grip:  Foam rubber, provides good grip and cushion.<br />&#62;Body: Channels prevent rotation.<br />&#62;Thumb locks: Operate quickly and smoothly, and lock securely---actually mine works just a tad too easily. I fear that with a little wear, that the locks will slip.  Unlike the less-convenient &#34;twist to lock&#34; design (used on many other monopods/tripods), you can't just &#34;twist harder&#34;---there is nothing you can do if the lock doesn't hold.  Honestly, I am torn about applying a little silicon grease to the locks to minimize wear, and the concern that the grease might encourage slipping.  If you get one with tight leg locks, the silicon grease is highly recommended, it will both make the action smoother and protect against wear---lightly apply to the levers where they rub against the monopod column.  [[ASIN:B000AL8VD2 Permatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.]] Note that unlike petroleum grease, silicon grease does not damage plastic or attract dirt.<br />&#62;Tip:  Metal tip for hard surfaces; plastic tip screws out over metal tip for indoor surfaces.  Neither tip can come loose and get lost.  The metal tip is not particularly sharp, and the plastic tip is not soft.  That is, the metal tip might slip on smooth rocks or hard ice, and while the plastic tip will protect most indoor surfaces from scratches, it does little to protect your camera from the jarring of impacts (which is VERY bad for cameras).  Therefore it is best NOT to leave your camera on your monopod if you use the monopod as a walking stick.  A &#34;quick connect&#34; such as [[ASIN:B00006JQ6C Sima Quick Connect for Tripod]] can be handy.<br />&#62;Case:  Rugged, attractive black nylon, with full-length zipper and an adjustable shoulder strap.  Unfortunately the case will not close with a ball head attached.  The usual plastic fittings will not rust, but can be broken by abusive use.<br /><br />AS A TRAVEL MONOPOD<br />At 21&#34; collapsed the monopod is too large to fit in most airplane carry-on luggage.  Airport security will probably confiscate it if found.  17oz is on the heavy side for travel.  For travel, I use a very similar [[ASIN:B000W8SSDG Norazza Monopod-lightweight TD140]], which collapses to 15 ½&#34; x ¾&#34; diameter, weighs only 7oz, but is too short (52&#34;) for birding and some other situations.<br /><br />AS A TRAVEL MONOPOD / WALKING STICK / HIKING POLE<br />A proper hiking pole needs a substantial strap, so that you do not have to have a death-grip on the grip for hours at a time.  The supplied lanyard is totally inadequate for this purpose and cannot be replaced with a more substantial strap.  However, if use a ballhead, you can install the ends of a replacement strap beneath the ball head.  I have not found replacement straps for sale---but you can make one from a 12&#34; length of 1&#34; black nylon webbing you probably have lying around from old equipment---use a soldering gun to cauterize 1/4&#34; holes in the webbing, 1/2&#34; from each end.  For travel, when I will be hiking, I use a [[ASIN:B000MB6T2U Stansport Outdoorsman Trekking Pole]] which has camera threads (and therefore can be used as a monopod), and has a very sharp metal tip for gripping ice or rocks and a very shock absorbing rubber tip for indoor surfaces (but I use the rubber tip outdoors to protect my camera from jarring).<br /><br />ESSENTIAL ACCESSORY<br />MANY reviewers report that the head (where your camera screws onto the monopod) can break off attached to your camera, and then can be difficult to remove from your camera.  The best insurance against damage to your camera is to use a ball-head or tilt head, which I consider essential anyway (or a &#34;quick connect&#34; see above).  For example, [[ASIN:B000L47AHG Professional Mini Ball Head Camera Mount]] which is adequate for small to medium-size cameras.  Unfortunately the monopod will not fit in the case with the ball-head attached.  The silicon grease I mentioned earlier will also make the action of a ball head smoother---usually only a concern shooting video on a tripod, but it's worth knowing.  But keep the silicon very far from your lens---it may be very difficult to remove.<br /><br />BALL HEAD OR TILTHEAD<br />For video, when you will never take verticals---a tilt head is by far the best solution, the limited motion is more controllable. [[ASIN:B001A1POL8 Manfrotto 234 Monopod Tilt Head (Replaces 3232)]]  But for stills, when you may want to take an occasional vertical, a ball-head is preferred.

       " \"I purchased this supplement after reading over 100 Amazon reviews of the product, 90% of which were very positive. I was looking for a supplement to combat fatigue, and got something that helped me with much more.<br /><br />The following review is a chronological account of a month long trial of this supplement with some extended updates. I hope it will help you to decide whether this product is for you.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE: Any mention of my health issues added to this review was done in hopes of assisting others who may be interested in taking this supplement. I generally don't like to share personal information such as medical conditions in a review, but I feel that for those suffering from similar conditions, it may be helpful. However, this is just my experience with this product and I in no way advocate using it to treat any of your ills without first consulting your doctor.<br /><br />What led me to this supplement, a little background...<br /><br />I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 15 years ago by Dr. David Dryland; a rheumatologist who is also a nationally known specialist in fibromyalgia. (He and has a few books on Amazon: [[ASIN:0976649004 The Fibromyalgia Cure]] and [[ASIN:0446698172 The Fibromyalgia Solution: A Breakthrough Approach to Heal Your Body and Take Back Your Life]].)  While I've taken various medications in the past to manage FMS, they all seem to have side effects - including the ones prescribed by Dr. Dryland.<br /><br />Currently I manage my fibro with no prescribed medication. I believe in a holistic approach to health, using both western and naturopathic means in combination as needed for various things.<br /><br />I take ibuprofen, eat healthy foods, get rest as needed and exercise. I lift weights and do 20-30 minutes of moderate to intense cardio 3-4 times a week, and take several supplements including: Optimum Nutrition Opti-Women, Women's Multivitamin, 120 Capsules, CoQ10, Fish Oil, Biotin, Red Rice Yeast, and Jarrow Formulations Jarrow L-glutamine 1000mg, 100 Tablets.<br /><br />Recent fatigue combined with hair loss has led to extensive blood tests by an endocrinologist to look at my hormone levels and thyroid function; both of which showed no abnormalities. Imaging tests showed the thyroid to be `lumpy' but  normal. A CT scan showed a cyst on my adrenal gland, which was determined to be benign.<br /><br />Symptomatically I have also experienced brain fog (unclear thoughts, `word salad' - picking the wrong word to express myself verbally, memory loss), irritability, insomnia, hair loss and hot flashes.<br /><br />Reading an article on adrenal fatigue, I decided to look for a book on it on Amazon, I found this supplement.<br /><br />I asked my primary doctor about `adrenal fatigue' and he wasn't convinced it was a real thing. Despite this, he said that trying Gaia Herbs Adrenal Health shouldn't be harmful, so I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />NOTE: Please ask your doctor prior to trying this supplement or any supplement as they can be harmful to some.<br /><br />More info on this supplement can be found at GaiaHerbs dot com in their products section.<br /><br />MY 1st WEEK:<br /><br />I took the recommended dosage - 2 capsules, twice a day after meals. I noted no stomach upset with Adrenal Health, but did note a persistent headache and stuffy head all week. I had also gotten a flu shot so perhaps it was all my immune system finding a balance again?<br /><br />On a positive note, I have felt more positive, and calmer overall. I still get stressed, but the feeling seems to subside a bit more quickly than usual.<br /><br />I'm still achy and tired, but that too seems a touch less pronounced. (One thing about fibro is that your body is in a constant state of 'fight or flight', which means a high level of adrenaline is being released all the time. This makes your muscles and tendons ache, and no amount of relaxing thoughts, will calm it down if you're in a flare - which can last for months.)<br /><br />I have been able to concentrate and complete tasks more easily too. My focus is better, with short term memory returning. (I've been enjoying Scrabble on my iPad again, after months of being unable to do so without frustration.)<br /><br />I've slept pretty well, having a few dreams, which is rare for me. No groggy feeling in the morning, and other than the headache (which could be from allergies, a cold coming on, my flu shot, or these pills...), I feel pretty good.<br /><br />As a bonus my appetite for sugary sweets and carbs has dropped off significantly. My appetite in general is less, and the usual evening (9pm-11pm) snacking is gone. I'm starting to drop body fat that's been stubbornly hanging onto my midsection for months, and have dropped two pounds in a week without changing anything other than taking this supplement.<br /><br />I'm not ready to scream 'buy these' at the top of my lungs to anyone with FMS, CFS or similar ills, but right now, I'm feeling like these subtle, positive changes are a direct result of the only new thing in my routine: Gaia Herbs Adrenal Health.<br /><br />I will update this review as I continue to take these capsules as directed.<br /><br />9/17/13: UPDATE - Headache returned when I took the second daily dose too close to the first. Spacing them out at least 6 hours seems to work well for me.<br /><br />My 2nd WEEK:<br /><br />I continue to take this supplement at directed (4 a day). No magical cure, but I do feel calmer and less scatter brained. My sense of humor is coming back, and much needed as life's ups and downs continue to toss me about.<br /><br />I've noticed no substantial side effects and am sleeping very well, without a grogginess upon waking. I'm dreaming and actually feel rested (albeit still achy) each morning.<br /><br />My appetite for sugary drinks and carbs has dropped off, and I lost another pound this week without any effort. I do eat well and exercise regularly, so it's nice to have that doing its job again! Energy levels are not high, but I do feel more alert in the afternoon and able to complete my 'to do' list without feeling like I need a nap.<br /><br />I will continue to take Adrenal Health in hopes that this trend will continue.<br /><br />3rd WEEK:<br /><br />I had a tough time remembering to take this supplement twice a day this week. Also, despite having had a flu shot, I got sick.<br /><br />I feel whipped and achy, but I'm continuing to sleep well and feel like the Adrenal Health when taken at the full dose, does help me to roll with the punches of life a bit more than without it.<br /><br />4th WEEK:<br /><br />One month's worth of Adrenal Health supplement later, and I still like it.<br /><br />Here's why...<br /><br />1. I'm sleeping better - dreaming again, and seem calmer overall.<br /><br />2. It's a stressful time in my life, and yet I feel like I'm keeping things in perspective better than I was before taking Adrenal Health.<br /><br />3. I've stopped putting on body fat (a nice perk...) and my appetite for sugar and carbs has subsided.<br /><br />4. I feel as though my mental clarity is better. Less brain fog.<br /><br />5. I have experienced fewer hot flashes and night sweats.<br /><br />6. I feel less weary all the time. No grand energy boosts, but a sustained energy and clarity that I've been missing for a long time, seems to have returned while taking this product.<br /><br />I still take it as suggested on the bottle; twice a day (2 capsules). I notice no side effects other than I tend to perspire more during workouts.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue. (I recommend asking your doctor prior to trying any new vitamin or supplement.) It's not a magic pill, but it may help in the management of conditions related to overactive 'fight or flight' response in the body.<br /><br />UPDATE: 10/24/13<br /><br />I figured out that these supplements are really helping to stop my night sweats and hot flashes. I'm thrilled! This stuff has had so many positive effects and I feel like I may be restoring a balance to my system that had been lost.<br /><br />UPDATE: 11/12/13<br /><br />Still taking it, and finding that I need to be sure to take the first dose right after breakfast (6:30am) and then a second dose (2 pills each time) between noon and 2pm to get the optimum effects.<br /><br />I tried dropping down to 2 pills a day, taking them after my lunch, but find this just isn't enough for me.<br /><br />UPDATE: 2/2/14<br /><br />I'm sold on the effectiveness of these capsules for me. Taking them consistently, 4 a day (2 in the morning and 2 at noon) I feel calmer with no night sweats or hot flashes. Energy levels throughout the day fluctuate much less frequently as long as I also maintain a good diet. I recommend them as a 'give them a try' to anyone who feels tired, down and or is having issues with hormones.<br /><br />UPDATE: 4/27/14<br /><br />I ran out and forgot to reorder. After two weeks I felt my weight starting to creep up, I was more tired and night sweats had returned. I've not put this item on my Amazon Subscribe and Save list. I will have it shipped to me every month this way, and if I find I need it less often, it's easy to adjust in my Account settings. For me, this is one supplement I definitely don't want to be without!<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/8/15<br /><br />I'm still taking this supplement and now in combination with Gaia Herbs Tumeric for inflammation and using a combipatch (DR RX) for reduction of menopausal symptoms - extreme hot flashes and night sweats during the past six months were not controlled in any other way. I feel that this supplement is a great help to me in terms of maintaining my mood and energy. My blood work is all normal and I'm rarely sick with a cold or flu. (I do get a flu shot each year as recommended by my doctor due to my auto-immune disorder.) I am having some increased joint pain and swelling, which my doctor may be rheumatoid arthritis - being tested next month.<br /><br />Despite these challenges I still believe this is a great product and a key component to my overall well being. I recommend it to anyone, but do understand that this has been MY experience with this supplement and as with any drugs or supplements, your experience may be different.its job again!

       " 'I have not used this much but so far I really like it. We have an upright, but it does not work well on our bare hardwood floors. Since we moved into a loft space, we do not have the acreage of carpets we used to have. The Panasonic canister works better on the floors, of course, but also on the area rugs and carpets we now have.<br /><br />I especially like the fact that it has a very large bag so it does not need changing every time you vacuum. Also, the wand is quite long which is good for a tall fat guy with a bad back. The wand also telescopes out for work and in for storage.<br /><br />You can leave the power head on it and slide the wand into a connector on the canister and the whole unit stays together when stored (you do not even have to remove the hose). The tools all fit into a compartment except for one that clips onto the wand. Then the whole thing stands there kind of like a golf bag. Not bad. I guess most canister vacuums do something like this these days but our last one was an Electrolux from the \\'70s.It worked wonderfully but was not exactly long on convenience.<br /><br />Of course, the basic thing is, does it pick up the dirt? So far, yeah. Really well. I got a lot of cat hair up with it and the cleaning ladies had already been here with their Dyson. So kudos for Panasonic I guess. And the cleaning lady tried it out and liked it quite a bit. High praise, believe me.<br /><br />I do have two beefs, however.<br /><br />One is not with the vacuum cleaner but with the listing here on the site (unless Amazon has fixed it). You know that place down below the write up that says \\\\\\\\\"Frequently Bought Together\\\\\\\\\"? Well there is a HEPA filter listed that does not go with this vacuum cleaner. Does not fit. Useless. Two other people have reviewed the filter itself and have gotten stuck with this filter that doesn\\'t fit a similar Panasonic canister vacuum either. One of the reviews for the filter is 6 month\\'s old, too. The filter is too small. And I own it, and it\\'s not worth sending back for $6 I guess. Amazon, you need to fix this.<br /><br />The second beef is that apparently there are no filters to be had for this that are OEM equipment. This is a big no-no directed at Panasonic. Come on, boys, catch up and provide some filters for this thing. I\\'m not sure I would have bought this if I had known that the HEPA filter that fit it is apparently not available on Amazon or anywhere else ... except maybe as a last resort you can call an 800 number at Panasonic. Not exactly modern marketing. I am ordering a filter meant for Kenmore and another Panasonic model that should fit based on the dimensions, and should be good quality. I will report back.<br /><br />[NOTE: Since writing this (last night) I found a review among the ones here on Amazon for this vacuum that lists the model numbers for filters and bags. Dunno where she found them, but thanks, and here they are:<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\"here are the correct replacement parts for Model MC-CG937:<br />HEPA Media Exhaust Filter: MC-V199H (V-194 had been recommended -- that\\'s not correct. Way too small. Does not fit)<br />Dust Bag (C-19) MC-V295H (V150 had been recommended. Not what the product manual says)<br />Belt (Type CB3) MC-V370B\\\\\\\\\"]<br /><br />Also there is a second filter called a motor safety filter that I cannot find anywhere online. I apparently do not have to deal with it for about a year, so I\\'ll keep my eye out for one.',\n",
       " \"This vitamin C serum has given me excellent results so far. I use it after cleansing and before moisturizing, and have tested it for a month. I feel it has given me brighter skin with fewer fine lines. However, I feel that if I don't use the serum, the results do not last, so it's a product that you need to schedule into your daily regimen to continue to enjoy the effects.<br /><br />With a one-year-old, it feels good that I can do this small thing for myself to look and feel a little brighter and less tired.<br /><br />I received a sample for testing and review.\",\n",
       " \"I received this product for free to review from the Amazon Vine program. The TP-Link N 600 is your standard router. It has a high bandwidth rate, and supports both wired and wireless networking. It has a far reaching range that extends to the farthest end of our house. We use it for streaming video with both upstairs and downstairs Roku devices and it works fine for that.  We also use it for PCs, smart phones, tablets and a wireless printer. The only issue we have had is that it seems to drop signal for no apparent reason on occasion. One second we'll be surfing the Internet humming along, and then a few times a day lately we'll lose the connection. Usually, we just have to wait for a minute or two, but sometimes we have to restart the whole unit itself. Aside from this minor annoyance, it's a decent product and works well most of the time.\",\n",
       " \"I’m very pleased with this yoga mat mainly due to the thickness. The foam is about 5/8 inch thick, which makes it far more cushy than my old mat. The foam density is on the medium/firm side of the spectrum – firm enough that I don’t sink through and feel the floor, but soft enough that it provides good padding for my aging parts.<br /><br />Given the thickness, this could be used as a general purpose exercise mat, rather than just a yoga mat.<br /><br />It has a good quality carry strap to make it easy to tote around.  The strap is a black nylon and contrasts nicely with the blue mat color.<br /><br />The downside to this thickness is bulk when the mat is rolled up. If I roll it up tightly and strap it together with the carrying strap, the total width is about 7.5 inches. That’s not too bad, but it has more bulk than the thin mats.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have is that it had a rather funky smell when I first took it out of the plastic wrapper. I needed to air it out for a day outdoors to get rid of the smell.  The smell did go away, so I won't detract from the rating due to that.<br /><br />Other than the initial smell, no complaints. It works well, has ample cushioning, and the foam appears to be of good quality to stand up to a lot of workouts.<br />[Sample provided for review]\",\n",
       " \"I was very surprised when I took this mesh bag out of its little pink carrying case. The mesh bag is huge, compared to other bags of its type I've seen.<br /><br />It is large enough for a couple of beach towels, a bunch of beach toys, lunch and snacks and drinks plus MORE for your day at the seashore.<br /><br />I've used it as a dirty laundry bag in our travel trailer and it holds quite a pile of dirty clothes.<br /><br />It's good, too, to carry clean clothes, towels, toiletries, etc. to the showers at the campground.<br /><br />I also used it as a grocery bag (after machine washing it after having dirty laundry in it) and I was able to put about three bags of groceries in it and carry them comfortably.<br /><br />The bag washes nicely in the washing machine and then I let it air dry.<br /><br />The straps are adjustable so I can throw this over my shoulder and there is also a drawstring around the top of the bag to keep your possessions more secure.<br /><br />This is a versatile and attractive mesh bag.<br /><br />NOTE:  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.\"]"
